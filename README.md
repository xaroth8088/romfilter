# romfilter
A utility for filtering one's MAME ROM collection

# Getting Started
This project is extremely early in its development.  Nonetheless, if you'd like to try it out, you'll need:
* Python 3.4
* An extracted copy of the "full driver information in XML format" file from http://mamedev.org/release.html
** Be sure that the version you've downloaded matches the version of your ROM set!
* Optionally, an extracted copy of catver.ini from http://www.progettosnaps.net/catver/
* A ROM set that you want to filter
* Enough spare disk space to have the copy of all of your ROMs
** This is because this utility is non-destructive.  We wouldn't want to accidentally nuke your collection!
